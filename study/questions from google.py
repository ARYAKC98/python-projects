#1Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.
# str = "hello madam"
# print(len(str))
#     #print(str)


#2Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list
# lst = [1,2,3,4,8]
# total = sum(lst)
# print(total)


#3Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list
#1st method - using sort method and set the numbers in ascending order and find the largest number

# lst1 = [2000,8000,4000,1000]
# lst1.sort()
# print(lst1)
# print("the largest element is:",lst1[3])

#2nd method using max()method
# lst1 = [2000,8000,4000,1000]
# print("print the largets element:",max(lst1))

#Write a Python program to get the smallest number from a list.
# lst1 = [2000,8000,4000,1000]
# print("smallest number is:",min(lst1))
